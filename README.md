# Simple-Pendulum
This repository contains MATLAB code to simulate the motion of a simple pendulum and analyze its behavior. The project demonstrates both the small-angle approximation and the non-linear pendulum equations of motion, focusing on visualizing kinetic energy (KE), potential energy (PE), and total energy (TE) for different initial angles.
